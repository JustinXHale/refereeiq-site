# RefereeIQ — Rugby laws, explained in seconds — anywhere, anytime.

From quick calls to in-depth scenarios, RefereeIQ helps you make sense of the game.
Meet **Sofia**, your friendly rugby laws coach. She’s trained to understand the flow, nuance, and context of Rugby Union — so you can have real, back-and-forth conversations about even the most complex situations.

Whether you’re a player, coach, fan, or referee, RefereeIQ helps you:
- **Get clear answers fast** to your rugby law questions.
- **See the game through a referee’s eyes** to understand on-field calls.
- **Explore “what if” scenarios** for a deeper grasp of the game’s context.

> Unlike a law book that only gives you black‑and‑white text, RefereeIQ adds the missing layer: *context*. Know not just what the law says — but why a call was made, or why it wasn’t.
